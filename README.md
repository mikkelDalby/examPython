# Python exam project
## Web crawler
To run the script, clone the project, direct to the project folder and run the webscrape.py file like below. The "\<index url\>" is optional and defines wich url to start the crawl from.
```Terminal
python webscrape.py <index url>
```
If no url is provided the default url https://clbokea.github.io/exam/ will be used as index url.
When each url is scraped, the content is converted to markdown and a .md file is created in the scrapes folder.
