# Exam, Python elective Spring 2019
## Exam flow
The exam is an oral exam where part of it is based on your handed in project. The exam is evaluated according to the\n            7 step scale.
The 3 last weeks of this elective you will be given 4 projects from which you should choose 1 as your exam\n            project.
The project should be published at Github and a link to the repository should be handed in on Wiseflow. If\n            your repository is private you should grant me (clbokea - clbo@kea.dk) access to your private repository.\n        
The project should be in a state where it is possible to clone the project and run it on the teacher and\n            sensor computers. There should be a readme file in the repository describing the project and how to install\n            and run it.\n        
If you fail to hand in the project, you can not attend the exam.\n        
Exam time: Total 30 min.
You will be graded on the:
During the exam the you will be asked to do "live coding".
The projects from where the you should choose 1 exam project are:
## Specific projects
## General for all projects
 All projects have been solved by someone else in the world before you, so it would be possible to pip\n            install a\n            module that more or less solves the task. It is not a good idea to use this approach. You should solve the\n            task from scratch and use the python techniques you learned during this semester.\n            On the other hand it is fine to use the build in modules that we used during this semester, and it can also make sense in some cases to use 3rd party modules.
